# Getting Started

The project represents a simple tic-tac-toe game which user plays with a server. 
Reset options and game statistics are also available.

###### By default, you play as a â˜• warrior! Sorry, tea enjoyers :)

This project consists of backend (run with **Express.JS**) and fronted servers (run with **React.JS**). Client-side was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
